# Engineering_4_Notebook

## Hello Raspberry Pi

### Lessons Learned

We learned the basics of Raspberry Pi in this assignment. This involved setting up the whole wire configuration thing and getting it to work on the computer. Then, we familiarized ourselves with terminal, and we wrote some basic code to get the mind gears turning. This was helpful in learning how to navigate our way through terminal, which was a bit confusing at first.

## Hello Mathematica

### Lessons Learned

We learned how to work with a super smart calculator. It is cool to see all the different things that it can do. The tough part here was creating the adjustable graph. In the beginnnig, we had no idea what to do, but with  our best friend Google, we were ablt to find the necessary parts to the equation little by little until we had something coherent.

## Hello Python

### Lessons Learned

Here, we learned the basics of Python. The goal was to make a "dice roller" that repeatedly spits

## Python Calculator

### Lessons Learned

We did some calculations in python. By entering two numbers in place of variables, Python will add, subtract, etc for us and generate a value for us. It was pretty simple once we figured out how to write the code for one of the calculations, and that only took a bit of research. It did take a bit of time to get the specifics down so that the format of the answer had the correct amount of digits and such.

## Quadratic Python

### Lesson Learned

By inputting a few numbers for the coefficients, we  were able to get the value for the discriminant, which Python solves for us. It took a while to figure out the exact syntax for everything, but the hardest part was understanding how the "else", "if", and "elif" statements worked in conjunction with each other. For the most part, however, it was fairly easy to understand.

## Hello Git

### Lessons Learned

We set up our Git pages. This whole process was fairly straightforward as we just had to follow some directions, but it did take a decent amount of time to complete.

## Git - Forks and Clones

### Lessons Learned

This involved the whole collaboration part of the Git page. We had to put our name, page, and a fun fact into the cool-repo page. It took us a while to figure out how to navigate everything to be able to upload our information, and then we forgot to put it into the main page instead if just the forked version. This was a simple fix, but it took us a while to figure out where we went wrong.

## Git - Engineering 4 Notebook

### Lessons Learned

This was just putting stuff into our notebook. This was a pretty simple assignment, but it took a long time to upload everything and write descriptions for all of our assignments. There were not really any difficulties we ran into.

## Python - Strings and Loops

### Lessons Learned

We learned how to use some for statements to make a vertical line of letters. I also finally learned what "char" means (it means character). Otherwise, all we had to do was define some terms and it was overall pretty simple.

## Python - Pinata

### Lessons Learned

This was quite a complicated assignment. We had to make a whole hangman game from scratch, and this was not easy as we had never really done anything like it. We had to pull bits of code from different things we found on the internet, and it took a lot of editing to get it to where it met our needs. It took us awhile to write the code for tha actual hangman picture, as we had to configure it so that the spacing was exactly right, which took some trial and error.

## GPIO Pins - Bash

### Lessons Learned

The main thing we learned here is how to put on the GPIO wires correctly. The code was fairly simple, and it was finished for a while, but our wires were reversed and it took us forever to figure this out. As soon as we made this simple fix, everything worked.

### Code

## GPIO Pins - Python

### Lessons Learned

This was pretty much the same code as the last but just in a slightly different format. We just had to figure out how to write it in a way that Python would be happy with which was not too difficult. We just had to find one or two lines that we didn't originally think of.

### Code

## GPIO Pins - SSH

### Lessons Learned

This assignment was pretty much just following the steps. The apps were blocked on our chromebooks, so we had to use one of our phones. It took us a while to figure out that instead of setting the password as "raspberry" we put "Rasberry" because I don't know how to spell. Besides that, it was pretty easy to set up and entering the code was simple.

## Hello Flask

### Lessons Learned

Completing the assignment was fairly straight-forward so we didn't run into any complications, but this assignment helped us to understand how Flask can help us. It was cool to see how we could connect to the pi straight from a web browser after writing just a few lines of code.

### Code

## GPIO Pins - Flask

### Lessons Learned

For this assignment we created an IP address to have two buttons which controlled the LEDs connected to the breadboard. We then had a little bit of fun with the background and layout of that page, with a cool color blend.

### Code

## GPIO Pins - I2C

### Lessons Learned

This assignment involved a new gadget called the LSM303. This would be the display on which our graph would be shown. The assignment gave us some of the commands we had to use to set up the accelerometer and magnetometer, which was the easy part. Then, we had to transfer that information being run by the simpletest.py.

### Code

## Headless

### Lessons Learned

We had to figure out how to make an animated line plot first, which we found the code for online, then made a few adjustments. We picked the option of making it run at startup, and that took a bit to get right as each trial would take a couple minutes. Once we had that, we just unplugged everything and put a battery in.
